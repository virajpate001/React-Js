- State is built-in object of the React Component 
- The state object is used to store all the data that belongs to that particular component only. 
- the state is only accessible inside the component it belongs to.
- State is mutable , it can be change as per need.
- Whenever the state object changes the component is re-rendered.
- To use state inside a class component "this.state" is used.
- To use state inside a functional component "useState" hook is used. 

Example 1) using Class Component 
1) Create personclass.js

 import React, { Component } from 'react'
 class personclass extends Component {
  constructor(props){
      super(props);
      this.props = props;

      this.state = { // assign state value 
        name : "Viraj",
        age : 25
       }
      }
     }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <div className='innerDiv'>
        Name is {this.state.name}
        </div>
        <div className='innerDiv'>
        Age is {this.state.age}
        </div>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default personclass;

2) Import on app.js
