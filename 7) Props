- React is a component-based library which divides the UI into little reusable pieces.
- In some cases, those components need to communicate(Send data to each other) and the way to pass data between component is by using props. 
- "Props" is a special keyword in React , which stand for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another. 
- But the important part here is that data with props are being passes a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child).
- Props is "Object" 


Example 1) Create Props using Function Components
1) Create Function Components "person.js"
 - import React from 'react'
    const Person1 = (props) => {
    return (
    <div>Hello {props.name}</div>
    )
    }
   export default Person1; 

2) import on App.js
- import Person1 from './components/person';
  function App() {
  return (
    <Person1 name="Viraj"></Person1>
  );
  }
 export default App;
