- Redux is a predictable state management library for JavaScript applications. 
- commonly used with React to manage the state of the application in a centralized way.

A) 3 core concepts :
  1) Store : A store that holds the state of your application.
  2) Action : A Action that describe the type of change in the state of the application. 
              "What to Do"
  3) Reducer : A reducer which actually does the state transition depending on the action.
              "How to Do"


1) Store:
       - The Redux store brings together the state, actions and reducers. 
       - We have only a single store in a Reducx Application.  

2) Action: 
      - Action are plain javascript Object. 
      - it has a type field.
      - actions only tell "what to do", but they don't tell how to do.
  e.g. : return{
                  type: 'INCREMENT'
               }

3) Reducers:
         - Reducers are functions that take the initial state/current state/previous state and action as arguments and return a new state

      e.g : we get cuttet fruits (initial state And Action) & we added in mixer(Reducer) & then make a juice(New State).
