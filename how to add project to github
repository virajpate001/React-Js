To add your project to GitHub, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize Git in your project directory**  
   Open your terminal, navigate to your projectâ€™s root directory, and run:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. **Add all files to the staging area**  
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. **Commit your changes**  
   Add a message describing the initial commit:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

4. **Create a new repository on GitHub**  
   Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in. Click on **New** (under "Repositories") to create a new repository. Give it a name, make it public or private as you wish, and then click **Create repository**.

5. **Connect your local repository to GitHub**  
   GitHub will give you commands to connect your local project to the new repository. Copy and paste these commands in your terminal:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

6. **Push your code to GitHub**  
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   If your repository uses `master` as the default branch instead of `main`, replace `main` with `master` in the command above.

After this, your project should be live on GitHub, and any future changes can be pushed with `git push`!
