1. Merge Branches

   Step 1: Checkout the main Branch 
           - First, switch to the main branch (or whatever your primary branch is):
           - git checkout main
   Step 2: Pull the Latest Changes
           - Make sure your main branch is up to date with the latest changes from the remote repository:
           - git pull origin main
          
   Step 3: Merge the Other Branch into main
          ->> git merge feature-branch

   Step 4: Push the Merged Changes to the Remote Repository
          ->> git push origin main

2. Rebase Branches (Alternative Method)
   
   - Instead of merging, you can also rebase your main branch onto the other branch. This method rewrites the commit history for a cleaner project history.

   Step 1: Checkout the Branch to Rebase

          - Switch to the branch you want to add to the main branch:
          ->> git checkout feature-branch
  
   Step 2: Rebase onto main

         - Rebase the branch onto main:
         ->> git rebase main
         
         - Resolve Conflicts: If there are conflicts, resolve them as needed. After resolving conflicts, continue the rebase process:
         ->> git rebase --continue
   
   Step 3: Checkout main and Merge 
          
          - After successfully rebasing, switch back to the main branch and merge:
          ->> git checkout main
          ->> git merge feature-branch

  Step 4: Push the Changes
         ->> git push origin main
