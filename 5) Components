- Components are independent and reusable bits of code 
- Components are javascript files. 

Types of components :
1) Class Based 
- Class-based components are JavaScript classes that extend from React's Component class
- provide a way to define UI logic, handle state, and manage lifecycle methods. 

Example 1) 
import React, { Component } from 'react';
class Counter extends Component{

  render() {
   return (
     <div>
         <div> <h2>Name : Viraj</h2></div>
         <div> <h2>Age : 25</h2></div>
     </div>
   );
  }
}

export default Person;



2) Function Based 
- Functional components are JavaScript functions that return JSX to describe the UI.
- Functional components gained the ability to manage state and use lifecycle methods

Example 1) 
import React from "react";

function Man(){
   return <h1>Hello Viraj</h1>
}

export default Man;
