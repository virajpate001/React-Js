1. Main Branches : main or master Branch: This is the default branch and typically contains the production-ready code. 
                   Only stable and thoroughly tested code should be merged here.

2. Develop Branches : This branch is often used to integrate features before they are merged into main. 
                      It serves as a staging area where all feature branches are merged, tested, and refined before going live.

3. Feature Branches : When starting a new feature, bug fix, or enhancement, developers create a new branch off develop . 
                      git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

4. Pull Requests (PRs):  

   - Creating a Pull Request: Once the work on the feature branch is complete, the developer creates a pull request (PR) to merge the changes into develop.
  
   - Code Review: Team members review the code in the PR, suggest changes, and discuss improvements. This is a critical step in ensuring  code quality.

   - Continuous Integration (CI): Automated tests are usually run during the PR process to ensure that the new changes do not break existing functionality.

5. Merging and Deployment: 
    
   - Merge After Approval: Once the PR is approved, it is merged into the target branch (develop or main). In some workflows, feature branches are merged into develop and then periodically develop is merged into main.

   - Delete the Branch: After the merge, the feature branch is often deleted to keep the repository clean.

   - Deployment: The code in main is usually deployed to production. Some teams deploy from develop to a staging environment for further testing before merging into main.

6. Release Branches (Optional)

   - Preparing for Release: Some teams use a release branch to prepare for a new version. This branch allows for final tweaks, bug fixes, and testing before merging into main.

   - Tagging Releases: Once a release is ready, it's merged into main and a version tag is created.
   ->> git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release version 1.0"

7. Best Practices

   - Small, Frequent Commits: Make small, logical commits that are easy to review.
   - Descriptive Branch Names: Use descriptive names for branches (e.g., feature/add-user-auth, bugfix/fix-login-issue).
   - Rebase vs. Merge: Rebasing can be used to keep a clean commit history, but merging is safer in collaborative environments.
   - Regular Syncing: Regularly pull changes from the develop or main branch to keep your branch up to date.
   - Code Reviews: Always have code reviewed by peers to catch issues early.
