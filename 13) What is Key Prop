- The key prop is a special attribute that needs to be included when rendering arrays of elements or components.
- It helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.
- When you render a list of items in React using an array, each item in the array should have a unique key prop assigned to it. 

Example : 

import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const items = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange'];

  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{item}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
