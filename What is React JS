React JS : 
- React.js is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces or UI components. 
- particularly for single-page applications where user interaction is dynamic and frequent.
- It was developed and is maintained by Facebook.

Key features and concepts of React include:
1) JSX (JavaScript XML):
- JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML or HTML. 
- It allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript files
- making it easier to visualize and understand the structure of the UI.

2) Component:
- React applications are structured as components, which are reusable and modular building blocks.
- Components encapsulate the logic and UI of a specific part of the application.

3) One-Way Data Binding:
- data in an application flows in a single direction, from parent components to child components.
- This helps in managing the state of the application and makes it more predictable.

4) Virtual DOM (Document Object Model)
- React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering.
- Instead of directly manipulating the actual DOM, React creates a virtual representation of it in memory. 
- When there are changes, React calculates the most efficient way to update the real DOM.

5) React Router: 
- React Router is a library that enables navigation and routing in React applications.
- It allows developers to define routes and map them to specific components.

6) React Hooks: 
- Hooks are functions that allow developers to use state and lifecycle features in functional components, enabling the use of stateful logic without writing a class.
